Computer Architecture and Assembly Language - Assignment 1

## Problem Breakdown

### Part (a): Edit Distance
Compute the edit distance between two 8-bit binary numbers. The edit distance represents the number of bits that differ between two binary numbers. The values are stored in registers `r16` and `r17`, and the result is stored in `r25`.

### Part (b): Resetting the Right-most Contiguous Set Bits
Identify and reset the right-most contiguous set bits in a given 8-bit number. The input is in register `r16`, and the result is stored in `r25`. A flowchart illustrating the solution is also provided.

### Part (c): Addition of Two Packed BCD Numbers
Add two binary-coded decimal (BCD) numbers. The operands are stored in registers `r16` and `r17`, and the result (right-most two BCD digits) is stored in `r25`, with the carry in `r24`.

## Files Included
