LED Control with Timers and Interrupts- Assignment 4

This project is broken down into four parts.
- **Part A**: Writing a function (`lcd_state()`) to turn an LED on or off based on a given state.
- **Part B**: Implementing a function (`SOS()`) to display the SOS Morse code pattern using LEDs.
- **Part C**: Creating a function (`glow()`) to simulate LED brightness using pulse-width modulation (PWM).
- **Part D**: Implementing a pulsing LED effect (`pulse_glow()`) by adjusting the PWM duty cycle over time.
- **Bonus**: Implementing a custom light show pattern (`light_show()`).

Files
- **a4.c**: Main source code implementing the solution.
- **Makefile**: Build configuration for compiling and uploading the code.
